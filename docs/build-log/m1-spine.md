## Built

- **Org scaffold (Aug 1):** seven public repos live in the
  [`platform-factory`](https://github.com/platform-factory) GitHub org
  (`platform-bootstrap`, `platform-config`, `systems`, `edge-config`,
  `template-service`, `svc-hello`, `platform-knowledge`). Each has a README
  stub, Apache-2.0 LICENSE, CODEOWNERS, and an active `main-protection`
  ruleset (PRs required, force pushes and branch deletion blocked). Org teams
  `platform` and `security` exist; `edge-config`'s CODEOWNERS routes
  `/external/` to `@platform-factory/security` — the approval boundary in
  file form, present from the first commit.
- **Terraform layer 0 (Aug 1–6, in review as PR #1):** `platform-bootstrap`
  authored as four independently-applied layers, split by lifecycle —
  `0-foundation` (project under the org, billing link, 8 APIs, state
  bucket, 6 Artifact Registry remote repos, dedicated `gke-nodes` service
  account), `1-network` (custom VPC, subnet + secondary ranges, gated HA
  VPN pair), `2-cluster` (regional private-node GKE, Cloud NAT,
  authorized-networks endpoint), `3-argocd` (Argo CD 10.2.2 via Helm +
  root Application as its own second `root-app` release — corrected
  mid-build from the `extraObjects` design, see surprise 8 — images
  rerouted through the AR caches). The boundary rule: **identity and reachability persist; compute
  is disposable** — teardown between sessions destroys only layers 2–3
  (this is the shape of the C-02 test, now with the corporate-shaped bill
  per ADR-0009). Seven review-hardened commits; nothing applied yet —
  apply waits on human review of the PR.

## Data

- Org scaffold wall-clock: under two hours for repos + rulesets + teams,
  fully via `gh` CLI; zero cloud cost.
- Build runs on a GCP Free Trial billing account ($300 / 90 days) under a
  fresh identity — trial window comfortably covers the M1–M4 timeline.
- **First apply (Aug 6, after human review of PR #1):** `0-foundation`
  applied clean on the first attempt — all 19 resources, including the six
  Artifact Registry remote repos. Notably the `xpkg.upbound.io` remote
  (the one flagged lower-confidence in `registry.tf`) was accepted by the
  AR API at create time; whether it actually proxies pulls is still the
  M2 check. Local→GCS state migration worked as designed. `1-network`
  applied clean immediately after (3 resources; VPN gated off).
- **First cluster apply hit a GCE stockout (Aug 6→7).** GKE's automatic
  zone selection for the regional cluster included `us-central1-f`, which
  had no `e2-standard-4` capacity; after 35 minutes the cluster landed in
  ERROR with 3 of 4 zones' nodes running. Fix required zero code change:
  the `node_locations` variable (already in the design as an override)
  pinned zones a/b/c via gitignored tfvars, and `terraform apply` with
  the tainted cluster replaced it cleanly. Two general notes: capacity
  stockouts are a fact of life even in a top-3 region on a mainstream
  machine type, and the "parameterize the escape hatch you hope not to
  need" habit is what kept this a tfvars edit instead of a PR.
- **The two browser logins recur per session, not once.** The Workspace
  org's default reauthentication policy expired both the CLI credential
  and ADC overnight (`invalid_rapt`). C-01's "irreducibly manual" list is
  therefore a per-session cost, not a one-time bootstrap cost — worth
  stating precisely when grading C-01.
- **Spine complete (Aug 7).** Cluster replacement (destroy ERROR cluster
  + regional recreate + node pool, zones pinned a/b/c): ~29 min
  end-to-end. `3-argocd`: argo-cd release live in 84s, root-app release
  in 3s; all pods Running; `root` Application Synced/Healthy against
  platform-config. **First live C-23 evidence:** every image on the
  cluster arrived through the Artifact Registry remotes — quay
  (argocd v3.4.6), ghcr (dex v2.45.1), and ECR Public (redis
  8.2.3-alpine) paths all resolve to
  `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/platform-factory-ref/...` — zero direct
  internet image pulls on the private-node cluster, three distinct
  upstreams proxied.

- **C-23 partial live evidence via NAT logs (Aug 13).** With NAT translation
  logging on (`filter = "ALL"`, see surprise 9), a 20-minute window of
  `resource.type="nat_gateway"` logs contains exactly one destination:
  `140.82.114.3:443` — reverse DNS `lb-140-82-114-3-iad.github.com`, WHOIS
  `OrgName: GitHub, Inc.` Zero connections to any public registry. This is
  the predicted shape (image plane on the Google-API path, one git pinhole),
  and it's the first evidence that doesn't rely on reading image *references*.
  **Deliberately not called conclusive.** Cloud NAT only sees traffic that
  needs NAT, and no pod started during the window, so no image pull would
  have crossed it either way — the absence of registry traffic is currently
  consistent with both "pulls ride Private Google Access" and "nothing
  pulled." Grading C-23 needs a forced pull: start a pod whose image isn't
  cached on its node, confirm it arrives from `*.pkg.dev`, and confirm NAT
  logs stay GitHub-only across the same interval. Recorded here rather than
  held back because the ledger of *what the evidence does not yet cover* is
  the part surprise 8 says gets skipped.
- **C-23 conclusive: forced pull, zero registry egress (Aug 13).** The gap
  named in the entry above is now closed. A throwaway pod pulled
  `busybox:1.36` through the `docker-hub` Artifact Registry remote —
  chosen precisely because `registry.tf`'s own comment records that
  nothing this repo installs pulls from it, so neither the node nor the
  remote had ever touched that path — with `imagePullPolicy: Always` to
  force a registry round-trip rather than a cache hit.
  The pull was real, not elided: kubelet reported **2.909s and 2,217,006
  bytes**, and the container status resolved to a `pkg.dev` digest
  (`us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/platform-factory-ref/docker-hub/library/busybox@sha256:73aaf090…`).
  Across the entire window, Cloud NAT logged **exactly one connection**:
  `140.82.113.3:443` — `lb-140-82-113-3-iad.github.com`, `OrgName: GitHub,
  Inc.` Zero connections to Docker Hub or any other registry.
  This is the strong form of the claim, and it demonstrates the mechanism
  rather than just the outcome: because this was the `docker-hub` remote's
  first ever use, Artifact Registry itself had to fetch the layers from
  Docker Hub upstream — and that fetch generated no node-side egress,
  because it happens on Google's side of the boundary. A private-node
  cluster with no internet route to any registry pulled a public image
  successfully. Four upstreams now proxied in practice (quay, ghcr,
  ECR Public, Docker Hub). C-23 is ready to grade at milestone close.
- **Operator IP churn is a recurring manual intervention (Aug 13).** The
  residential IPv4 in `authorized_networks` turned over
  (one residential address to another; the specific values are redacted — this repo is public and they geolocate) and the API server became unreachable.
  Failure mode is a `dial tcp ... i/o timeout`, not an authz error — GKE
  drops unauthorized source IPs rather than refusing them, so it presents as
  a network hang with no hint at the cause. Cost: one tfvars edit plus a
  `2-cluster` apply before any cluster work could happen. Same family as the
  per-session reauth, and both belong in C-02's manual-intervention count.
- **The two credentials expire independently (Aug 13).** `gcloud auth login`
  refreshed the CLI credential while Terraform continued failing on
  `invalid_rapt`, because the provider authenticates through Application
  Default Credentials — a separate token needing its own
  `gcloud auth application-default login`. Sharpens the earlier entry: it
  isn't "two logins per session," it's two independent credentials whose
  expiries don't coincide and where fixing one gives no signal about the
  other.

- **C-02 first scripted cycle (Aug 18).** `scripts/cycle.sh cycle 1`, the
  first end-to-end run of the harness. Down: `3-argocd` 65s, `2-cluster`
  486s, **total 9m13**. Up, after the failure below was fixed: `2-cluster`
  753s, `3-argocd` 87s, verify 12s — **~14m12 if it had run clean**. The
  `2-cluster` rebuild at 12m33 is the first clean baseline; the ~29 min
  recorded on Aug 7 included destroying a cluster stuck in ERROR.
  **Manual interventions: 1** (the IP fix in surprise 12; a second stumble,
  a shell left in the wrong directory, was operator error rather than a
  property of the system). C-02's target is zero, so the first cycle does
  not meet it.
  The verify step passed in **12 seconds** — the root Application reached
  Synced/Healthy with nobody clicking Sync, which is surprise 10's flip
  working as intended and the first evidence that the rebuild can finish
  unattended at all.

- **Control-plane access moved off the IP allowlist (Aug 20).** Three
  applies, deliberately sequenced so a failure could not lock the operator
  out. (1) `dns_endpoint_config.allow_external_traffic = false -> true` —
  in-place, nodes untouched; the DNS endpoint already existed, only external
  traffic was off. (2) `3-argocd`'s kubernetes/helm providers repointed from
  `cluster_endpoint` to the new `cluster_dns_endpoint`, dropping
  `cluster_ca_certificate` because `*.gke.goog` presents a publicly trusted
  certificate rather than the cluster's own CA. (3)
  `ip_endpoints_config.enabled = true -> false` plus deletion of
  `master_authorized_networks_config` and the `authorized_networks` variable.
  Evidence at each stage: the FQDN resolves through public DNS (`dig @8.8.8.8`
  -> `216.239.32.27`, a Google address — it is a public name, not an internal
  one); `kubectl get nodes` returned three Ready nodes over it; `3-argocd`
  planned `No changes` while refreshing **both** `helm_release` resources,
  which is the check that matters after surprise 12 — a plan proposing to
  *create* argo-cd would have meant the provider silently could not see the
  cluster. All three still held after the IP endpoint was disabled, which is
  what makes it conclusive rather than suggestive: the allowlist was never
  carrying that traffic. `2-cluster/terraform.tfvars` is now down to
  `node_locations` and contains no address at all. **The recurring failure
  from surprises 12 and the Aug 13 entry is deleted, not mitigated.**

- **Credential expiry, third direction (Aug 20).** Extends the two earlier
  entries. Terraform failed on ADC (`invalid_rapt`); after
  `gcloud auth application-default login` fixed that, `gcloud` itself failed
  separately with `Reauthentication failed`; and after `gcloud auth login`
  fixed *that*, the CLI came back pointed at a different active account and
  project than the cluster lives in, producing a 403 on
  `container.clusters.get` that reads like a permissions problem and is
  actually a context problem. Three distinct failures, three different error
  surfaces, none of which indicates anything about the other two. A `cycle.sh`
  preflight that checks only the credential that broke last time will keep
  being surprised.

- **Jump box, and Cloud NAT moved to the persist layer (Aug 20).**
  `1-network` gained six resources: a dedicated service account, an
  IAP-only SSH firewall rule, an e2-micro jump box with no external IP, and
  Cloud NAT relocated out of `2-cluster`. Ordering was forced — two NAT
  gateways cannot cover the same subnet ranges, so `2-cluster` had to destroy
  its gateway (`0 to add, 0 to change, 2 to destroy`) before `1-network` could
  create one. Argo CD's git traffic was the only casualty of the gap and it
  reconnected on its own; the root Application was `Synced/Healthy` on the
  next check.
  Verified over IAP with no public IP anywhere on the box:
  `gcloud compute ssh --tunnel-through-iap` returned a shell, `tailscale
  1.102.3` was installed, `net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1` was live and persisted to
  `/etc/sysctl.d/`, and `tailscale status` reported `Logged out` — ready for
  the one-time join. That apt reached the Debian repos at all is the
  independent proof the relocated NAT works.
  One latent bug found and fixed rather than left: nothing declared that the
  VM needs NAT, so Terraform created them concurrently and the startup
  script's one network-dependent step won the race by seconds. Now
  `depends_on` the gateway, with a retry loop around the install so a cold NAT
  degrades into a delay instead of a jump box that silently has no Tailscale.

- **Tailnet up; subnet routing measured, not assumed (Aug 22).** The jump box
  joined the tailnet and advertised all three ranges; routes approved in the
  admin console. Two nodes on the tailnet — the operator's laptop
  (`100.126.144.78`) and the jump box (`100.91.151.61`). Reachability tested
  from the laptop, over the tailnet, to private VPC addresses with no VPN, no
  public IP, and no allowlist anywhere in the path:

  | Advertised range | Target | Result |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `10.10.0.0/20` (nodes) | `10.10.0.24` jump box | reachable, ~52 ms |
  | `10.10.0.0/20` (nodes) | `10.10.0.21` GKE node | reachable, ~52 ms |
  | `10.20.0.0/16` (pods) | `10.20.1.6` Argo CD pod | reachable, ~55 ms |
  | `10.30.0.0/20` (Services) | `10.30.4.27` argocd-server | **unreachable** |

  Two of three ranges do what the design intended. The third never could —
  see surprise 16.

  Tailnet Lock was evaluated and deferred rather than enabled (ADR-0011): it
  needs at least two signing nodes, this tailnet has exactly two, one of them
  is a VM Terraform can replace, and initialization emits ten
  once-only disablement secrets whose total loss is unrecoverable. Real
  lockout risk against a threat model this build does not have.

- **Layer 0 touched again, to let the paved road pull its own providers
  (Aug 27).** Crossplane's package manager pulls with its own pod identity,
  not the node's, so the `gke-nodes` grant did nothing for it and every
  provider would have sat pull-denied. One additive binding in
  `0-foundation/iam.tf` — `roles/artifactregistry.reader` to
  `principal://…/subject/ns/crossplane-system/sa/crossplane`, the direct
  Workload Identity form with no Google service account and no key. Plan was
  `1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy`; the project policy now lists exactly
  two `artifactregistry.reader` members, the node SA and that principal.
  Cheap to apply and worth reading twice for what it implies about C-01 —
  see surprise 17.

- **C-02 cycle 2: the first clean cycle, and C-04's test in the same run
  (Aug 27–28).** Down (Aug 27 evening): `3-argocd` 55s, `2-cluster` 649s —
  **11m48**. Up (Aug 28, after the grant above): `2-cluster` 755s,
  `3-argocd` 119s, verify 173s — **17m32**. **Manual interventions: zero** —
  the first cycle to meet C-02's target, and the first run of the harness
  against a `platform-config` that isn't a stub.
  `2-cluster` came in at 755s against cycle 1's 753s, so the cluster rebuild
  is the stable part of the number and reproducible to within two seconds.
  All of the growth is downstream of it: `3-argocd` 87s → 119s and verify
  12s → 173s. Both are the cost of there finally being something to sync,
  which is the honest way to read the total going up while the run got
  cleaner.
  The same run is C-04's test — **a fresh cluster reached all-synced from
  empty with no manual ordering**: 3/3 Applications Synced/Healthy (`root`,
  `crossplane` at wave 0, `crossplane-providers` at wave 1) with all six GCP
  provider packages Installed and Healthy underneath. What it cost to get
  there is recorded as surprise 18 rather than buried here: the register
  predicted sync-wave friction the design doesn't acknowledge, and the
  prediction was right.

- **C-23 extended to the package plane, against a digest from 17 days
  earlier (Aug 28).** The Aug 13 evidence covered kubelet pulls. Crossplane's
  package manager is a different puller — its own pod, its own identity, its
  own resolution path — so this is a genuinely new test of the same claim
  rather than a rerun, and it passed.
  Every image on the rebuilt cluster resolves to `*.pkg.dev`: Crossplane and
  its rbac-manager (`ghcr-io/crossplane/crossplane:v2.3.5`, main *and* init
  containers) and all six provider packages
  (`ghcr-io/crossplane-contrib/provider-gcp-*:v3.0.0`).
  The mechanism is recorded by the component doing it rather than inferred
  from image strings: `ProviderRevision.status.resolvedImage` reads
  `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/platform-factory-ref/ghcr-io/crossplane-contrib/provider-gcp-storage:v3.0.0`,
  and `status.appliedImageConfigRefs` names
  `[{"name":"artifact-registry-mirror","reason":"RewriteImage"}]` — the
  package manager stating which rule rewrote the pull. Note the `Provider`
  resource still displays the canonical `xpkg.crossplane.io/...` package
  name; the rewrite is visible only one level down, which is worth knowing
  before someone reads `kubectl get providers` and concludes the mirror
  isn't working.
  And the artifact is provably the same artifact. Artifact Registry serves
  `sha256:a2170b5c616869f0a241d8877813c5f193198c7c7fd66476db2313dca46cfdf5`
  for `provider-gcp-storage:v3.0.0` — **byte-identical to the digest the
  2026-08-11 direct probe of `xpkg.crossplane.io` returned.** Two paths,
  seventeen days apart, same bytes; Crossplane names the revision from that
  digest, which is why the pod is `provider-gcp-storage-a2170b5c6168-…`.
  The egress side held across the entire rebuild. NAT translation logs for
  04:12–04:25Z contain exactly two destinations — `140.82.114.3:443` and
  `140.82.114.4:443`, reverse DNS `lb-140-82-114-{3,4}-iad.github.com`,
  WHOIS `OrgName: GitHub, Inc.` **Zero connections to any registry** while a
  fresh cluster pulled Crossplane, six provider packages, and a package
  dependency for the first time. Five upstreams now proxied in practice
  (quay, ghcr, ECR Public, Docker Hub, and the Crossplane package track via
  ghcr).

- **C-02 cycle 3: the target reproduced, and the cluster rebuild is a
  constant (Aug 28).** Down: `3-argocd` 58s, `2-cluster` 535s — **9m57**.
  Up: `2-cluster` 755s, `3-argocd` 115s, verify 162s — **17m18**. **Manual
  interventions: zero**, a second time.
  `2-cluster apply` came in at **755s in both cycle 2 and cycle 3** — the
  same number to the second, and 753s in cycle 1. Three runs spread over ten
  days agreeing within two seconds makes the regional-GKE rebuild the one
  genuinely predictable quantity in this build, which is worth knowing
  because it is also the dominant term: it is 73% of the up phase and every
  other component is noise beside it. Teardown is the variable half (535s,
  649s, 486s) — GKE's own drain behaviour, not anything this repo controls.

- **C-03's live half, short of the hands-on half (Aug 28).** With the
  providers Healthy on the rebuilt cluster, the doc-only kind check from
  Aug 11 can be re-run against a real API server: **all eleven kinds the
  Compositions need are Established CRDs, at both scopes** — cluster
  (`*.gcp.upbound.io`) and namespaced (`*.gcp.m.upbound.io`) — covering
  `DatabaseInstance`/`Database`/`User` (sql), `Bucket`/`BucketIAMMember`
  (storage), `ServiceAccount`/`ProjectIAMMember`/`ServiceAccountIAMMember`
  (cloudplatform), `RegistryRepository` (artifact), and
  `RecordSet`/`ManagedZone` (dns). 45 GCP provider CRDs in total, of 147 on
  the cluster.
  This is stronger evidence than the primary-source check — the kinds are
  installed and served, not merely present in a repo — and still not what
  C-03's test asks for. "Hands-on create of each kind" means a Composition
  materializing a real Cloud SQL instance and a real bucket, which needs the
  M2 paved road. Recorded so the distinction survives to the grade: the
  register's M1 assignment covers everything except the half that matters
  most.

## Surprises (running list — raw material for grading and the next ADR)

1. **The design said "a GitHub org, because the topology is the point" — and
   the build confirmed the org is load-bearing, not cosmetic.** The initial
   instinct was to scaffold under the existing user account; but user
   accounts cannot have teams, and team-based CODEOWNERS
   (`@platform-factory/security`) is what makes approval routing real rather
   than one username pasted everywhere. The claim C-15 test (rung enforceable
   by branch protection + CODEOWNERS alone) would have been untestable in a
   user-account topology.
2. **Solo-builder deadlock in the ruleset design.** The pattern assumes
   required reviews via CODEOWNERS, but GitHub won't let a PR author approve
   their own PR — with one human, `required_approving_review_count: 1` blocks
   every merge. Resolution: rulesets active from day one but with approval
   count 0; the count tightens when agent-authored PRs begin (M4), which is
   itself a cleaner story — the human reviewer requirement turns on exactly
   when a non-human author appears. This needs to be explicit in the M4 test
   design for C-15/C-16.
3. **The cost-optimal layer layout was not the corporate-real layout.** The
   first cut put the VPC in the torn-down-between-sessions layer, because a
   VPC is free and the cluster needs one. Ronak's correction: "in a real
   corporate environment, the cloud wouldn't live by itself — it would have
   other network connections." The mechanical forcing function agrees: an HA
   VPN gateway gets new Google-side public IPs when recreated, so a VPC that
   dies with the cluster means manually reconfiguring the peer (corp
   firewall, or the home-lab UniFi standing in for it) on every rebuild.
   Resolution: four layers — foundation and network persist; cluster and
   Argo CD are disposable. The boundary rule that fell out is worth keeping
   for the pattern docs: **identity and reachability persist; compute is
   disposable.** Cost yields to realism where they conflict (an idle VPN
   tunnel's ~$35–40/mo is the price of the theory being provable).
4. **The one-off network correction generalized into a standing rule
   (ADR-0009).** After the VPC promotion, the remaining cost shortcuts got
   re-examined and reversed as a set — zonal → regional control plane,
   public → private nodes (+ Cloud NAT + Private Google Access), spot →
   on-demand, unrestricted → authorized-networks API endpoint. Ronak's
   framing (Aug 6): "mock a real env as much as possible over costs —
   configure it like a normal corp environment would look and behave."
   Caught pre-apply, so it's a diff on an open PR; a week later it would
   have been a live migration. Recorded as ADR-0009: cost yields to realism;
   C-02's cheapness claim now gets tested with the corporate-shaped bill.
5. **"Only GCP APIs" was almost right — and the wrong storage idea led to
   the right architecture (ADR-0010, C-23).** Ronak proposed preloading
   Crossplane to a GCS bucket so the cluster needs nothing but Google APIs.
   GCS can't speak the OCI registry protocol, but the posture was correct:
   Artifact Registry remote repositories put every image pull on the
   Google-API path (Private Google Access), and the cluster's internet
   egress collapses to one named pinhole — Argo CD's git pulls from GitHub —
   which M3's FQDN work (C-14) then formalizes. Added C-23 to the register
   (dated, append-only) to grade this at M1.
6. **"Terraform's last job" cuts earlier than the first execution attempt.**
   The first instinct was `gcloud projects create` + billing link by hand,
   then Terraform from the VPC down. Corrected mid-session (Ronak): if
   Terraform ends at layer 0, layer 0 should *begin* at the project. The
   irreducibly manual set is small and worth naming as C-01 evidence:
   interactive browser auth (`gcloud auth login`,
   `gcloud auth application-default login`), free-trial signup, and one
   `terraform init -migrate-state` after the state bucket exists. Everything
   else is code.

7. **A from-nothing runbook step can become a hazard the moment the
   bootstrap succeeds.** `0-foundation` shipped with its GCS backend
   commented out — required for genesis, since the backend's bucket is
   created by the very layer it serves. But post-genesis that same state
   is a trap: a fresh clone running `terraform init` lands silently on
   empty local state, and its next plan proposes re-creating all of live
   foundation. Caught during the first real bootstrap, minutes after the
   apply; fixed by committing the backend enabled and inverting the
   runbook (commenting it out becomes the documented genesis-only
   exception). General form, worth carrying into the pattern docs:
   **bootstrap instructions have a half-life — the correct default flips
   from "assume nothing exists" to "assume everything exists" after
   exactly one successful run.**
8. **The researched workaround had its own apply-only failure mode — the
   evidence hierarchy is validate < plan < apply, and only apply is
   real.** The `extraObjects` design for the root Application was itself
   the fix for a verified plan-time wall (`kubernetes_manifest` can't
   bootstrap CRD-typed objects), and it validated and planned clean — then
   failed on the first real apply, because its premise (Helm installs a
   chart's `crds/` directory before templates) doesn't hold for the
   argo-cd chart, which *templates* its CRDs; Helm validates every
   rendered object against the cluster before applying any of them.
   Fixed as a second Helm release of a tiny in-repo `root-app` chart,
   validated at its own install time (platform-bootstrap PR #3, verified
   live). The durable rule: **a CRD-typed object never belongs in the
   same lifecycle step as the thing that defines its type** — the same
   boundary, one step earlier, that pushes Crossplane XRs into GitOps
   instead of Terraform (C-01).
9. **A pre-registered test can require evidence the build never ships.**
   C-23's test reads "inspect NAT logs / VPC flow logs: no egress to public
   registries" — but the built infrastructure emits neither. The subnet
   (`1-network/network.tf`) has no `log_config` block, so VPC flow logs are
   off; Cloud NAT (`2-cluster/nat.tf`) is set to `filter = "ERRORS_ONLY"`,
   which records *failed* connections only. A node successfully pulling from
   a public registry — precisely the thing the claim denies happens — would
   generate no log line at all. The claim isn't wrong and the config isn't
   wrong; they were written independently, and nothing forced them to meet.
   General form worth carrying into the pattern docs: **a claim's test is
   itself a requirement on the build.** Pre-registration (ADR-0008) catches
   vague success criteria, but it doesn't catch un-runnable ones — the
   register should have asked, at write time, "what must exist for this test
   to produce data?" Every remaining claim with an observability-shaped test
   (C-11's deny behavior, C-12's alert labels, C-18's escape detection) is
   worth re-reading with that question now, before its milestone.
10. **A conservative bootstrap default quietly made a claim's target
    unreachable.** `3-argocd`'s `root_app_automated_sync` defaults to
    `false` — sensible while bootstrapping, since it stops a
    half-authored `platform-config` from being applied to a live cluster
    the moment Argo CD starts. But C-02's target is *zero manual
    interventions* on rebuild, and with auto-sync off, every rebuild ends
    with a human clicking Sync. The claim cannot score zero against the
    configuration as shipped, and no amount of scripting fixes that —
    `scripts/cycle.sh` deliberately fails rather than papering over it.
    Same family as surprise 9 (the test is a requirement on the build),
    but the mechanism is worth separating: surprise 9 is a *missing*
    capability, this is a *present and deliberate* setting that happens to
    contradict a claim written elsewhere. Both were invisible until
    something tried to actually run the test. Decision needed before the
    C-02 runs: flip the default to `true` (and treat the bootstrap-safety
    concern as handled by `platform-config` being reviewed, not by Argo CD
    being idle), or amend C-02 to count the sync as an accepted manual
    step. The first is the honest version of the claim; the second is the
    honest version of the config.
11. **The cluster discarded every log it produced, for six days, silently —
    and the reason it went unnoticed is that the *other* half of
    observability was switched on for free.** `0-foundation` enables an
    explicit list of 8 APIs; `logging.googleapis.com` was not among them.
    Meanwhile the cluster runs with
    `loggingService = logging.googleapis.com/kubernetes` and
    SYSTEM_COMPONENTS + WORKLOADS enabled, and the node SA holds
    `logging.logWriter` through `container.defaultNodeServiceAccount` — so
    the config and the permissions were both right, and the writes went
    nowhere anyway. Nothing errored. Found only because C-23's NAT-log test
    tried to read logs that were never being stored.
    The trap is the asymmetry: creating a GKE cluster auto-enables a long
    tail of APIs as dependencies of `container.googleapis.com` — monitoring,
    autoscaling, gkebackup, telemetry, containerfilesystem, and more — and
    `monitoring.googleapis.com` is on that list. Metrics and managed
    Prometheus therefore worked from day one. Logging is *not* on that list.
    Half of observability enabled itself and masked the half that didn't, so
    every casual check ("is monitoring working?") returned yes.
    Two durable lessons. **An explicit allowlist is only as good as the
    review that built it** — the 8-API list was authored by reasoning about
    which layer needs which API, and logging isn't consumed by any Terraform
    resource here, so it never came up; it's consumed by the *running
    platform*, which no layer's code mentions. **And a dependency you get
    for free is a dependency you haven't declared**: monitoring worked by
    accident of GKE's behavior, not by anything in this repo. Both APIs are
    now pinned explicitly in `main.tf`. Worth carrying into ADR-0009's
    corp-real posture, which this quietly violated — a corporate cluster
    with no logs is not corp-real, and the posture checklist should name
    observability alongside private nodes and authorized networks.
12. **A "successful" teardown that tore nothing down — the Helm provider
    treats an unreachable cluster as an absent release.** The first
    `cycle.sh` run destroyed `3-argocd` in 65s and reported
    `Destroy complete! Resources: 0 destroyed`, exit 0. What actually
    happened: the operator's residential IP had cycled back to a
    previously-held address, so the workstation was outside
    `authorized_networks` and the kubernetes/helm providers could not reach
    the API server. Rather than failing, the provider refreshed both
    `helm_release` resources, concluded they no longer existed, and dropped
    them from state — leaving a plan containing nothing but output changes,
    annotated with Terraform's own cheerful "without changing any real
    infrastructure."
    It caused no damage here only by luck of ordering: `2-cluster`'s destroy
    removed the whole cluster eight minutes later. **A `3-argocd`-only
    teardown would have left Argo CD running while deleting Terraform's
    record that it exists** — state and world silently diverging, in the
    direction where Terraform believes less exists than actually does.
    Two lessons. The narrow one: unreachable is not absent, and any layer
    whose providers authenticate *through* a resource in another layer can
    fail this way — `terraform destroy` succeeding is not evidence anything
    was destroyed. The broad one belongs with surprise 8's evidence
    hierarchy: **exit 0 is not a result.** The same failure mode also hid a
    diagnosis in this session — an earlier `terraform plan` on this layer
    "succeeded" for exactly the same reason, and was misread as proof the
    cluster was reachable.
    Third occurrence of the dynamic-IP problem in ten days, second to block
    work outright. The structural fix is not tfvars discipline but
    `1-network`'s VPN (`enable_vpn`, still false): a corp environment
    authorizes a stable office/VPN egress CIDR, and pinning a dynamic
    residential /32 is an artifact of building from home without the tunnel
    ADR-0009's posture already calls for.
    **Superseded on Aug 20 (ADR-0011).** The fix named here — finish the VPN —
    was wrong, and wrong in a way the build log had already recorded three
    times without anyone checking the premise. See surprise 13.

13. **The fix this log named three times could never have worked.** Aug 13,
    Aug 18, and the closing note on surprise 12 all concluded the structural
    answer to residential IP churn was `1-network`'s VPN. Checking the primary
    source before building it: **Cloud VPN requires a static external IP on
    the peer gateway.** A dynamic residential lease cannot supply one, so the
    VPN does not solve the dynamic-IP problem — it inherits it, and enlarges
    the blast radius, because a changed address breaks the
    `external_vpn_gateway` resource and the entire private path instead of one
    allowlist line. HA VPN also requires BGP on the peer device, and an idle
    tunnel meters at ~$35–40/month.
    What made the error durable is that the conclusion was *plausible* and
    kept getting reinforced by recurrence: each new outage felt like more
    evidence for the remedy, when it was only more evidence for the problem.
    Three log entries asserted the fix; none tested it. This is surprise 8's
    evidence hierarchy pointed at the log's own reasoning rather than at a
    command's exit code — **a remedy repeated is not a remedy verified.**
    The deeper miss was a requirements error underneath the technical one. The
    stated need is for *users* to reach internal apps, SSH, and databases; a
    site-to-site VPN serves *locations*, and would have granted access to
    exactly one building while every remote developer still needed something
    else. The design had been carrying an unexamined 2010s assumption —
    that reachability is a network property — since ADR-0009.

14. **Disabling the IP endpoint leaves a live-looking address behind.** After
    `ip_endpoints_config.enabled = false`, the provider's `endpoint` attribute
    still reports the old control-plane IP (`34.55.89.82`), and `terraform
    output` still hands it to any consumer that asks. Nothing answers there:
    `curl` to it times out (exit 28) rather than being refused — the same
    silent-drop behaviour the authorized-network allowlist produced, and the
    same reason the Aug 13 outage read as a network hang instead of a config
    fact. A stale value that *looks* current is worse than an absent one,
    because it sends the next reader debugging connectivity for a problem that
    is really a configuration decision. The `cluster_endpoint` output was
    removed rather than documented in place. Same family as surprise 12:
    the dangerous failures here are the ones that return a confident,
    well-formed, wrong answer.

15. **Closing one door re-armed another, and the config still said "open."**
    Disabling the IP endpoints did not just change the field it was set on —
    GKE also flipped `private_cluster_config.enable_private_endpoint` from
    false to true, because with no public IP endpoint left that is what the
    older field now means. The Terraform config still carried the original
    `false`, so the very next plan read `enable_private_endpoint = true ->
    false`: an innocuous-looking one-line diff whose apply would have
    **reopened the public IP endpoint** and silently undone the whole posture
    change made an hour earlier.
    It surfaced only because an unrelated change — moving Cloud NAT to
    `1-network` — forced a plan on that layer and the diff was read rather
    than skimmed. Nothing about the original apply hinted the field existed;
    the security control and the field that drifted are in different blocks of
    the resource.
    The general shape is worth naming: **a hardening change can leave the
    config asserting the pre-hardened value for a neighbouring field, so the
    next routine apply quietly reverts it.** The window between the two is
    invisible, because the drift lives in the provider's view of the world
    rather than in anything the operator wrote. Related to surprises 12 and
    14 — all three are cases where the tooling gave a confident, well-formed
    answer that pointed the wrong way — but this one is worse than those,
    because the wrong answer would have been applied on purpose by someone
    reading a clean plan.

16. **A range can be reserved, advertised, accepted — and still be
    unreachable by construction.** `local.private_ranges` advertises the
    subnet primary range plus both GKE secondary ranges, and its comment
    promised "pod and Service IPs are reachable from the peer network too,
    not just node IPs." Measured over the tailnet: nodes reachable, pods
    reachable, **Service ClusterIPs not**. Nothing is misconfigured. ClusterIPs
    are virtual — kube-proxy rules on each node translate them, and they are
    never real addresses on the VPC network — so routing cannot reach them
    from outside no matter what is advertised.
    What makes this worth recording is how convincing the wrong version
    looked from the GCP side. The Services range is a real
    `secondary_ip_range` on a real subnet, it appears in the VPC IP plan
    alongside the pods range that *does* work, and both are configured
    identically in `ip_allocation_policy`. Nothing at the Terraform or GCP
    layer distinguishes the routable range from the one that only reserves
    addresses; the difference lives entirely in Kubernetes' implementation of
    Services, one abstraction above where the route is written.
    The comment had been wrong since it was written for the VPN, and survived
    because the VPN was never built — the same mechanism as surprise 13, where
    an assertion persisted precisely because nothing exercised it. Two of
    these in one milestone is a pattern rather than a coincidence: **this
    codebase's comments have been carrying untested capability claims, and
    they read exactly like tested ones.** The claims register is graded
    against evidence; comments are not, and that gap is where both errors
    lived.
    Reaching a Service by name from the tailnet is what the in-cluster
    Tailscale operator's Ingress is for — which is the concrete job for the
    operator that ADR-0011 kept as "additive, not a replacement" after moving
    the subnet router out to the jump box.

17. **"Workload identity" is a bootstrap item in the thesis and a recurring
    one in practice — and the very first grant is the one that cannot be
    delegated.** Bringing Crossplane up required a `0-foundation` apply on
    2026-08-27: an `artifactregistry.reader` binding on Crossplane's own
    Kubernetes service account, because the package manager pulls with its
    pod identity rather than the node's, so the `gke-nodes` grant does
    nothing for it.
    This is *inside* C-01 as written — the thesis names "workload identity"
    among the things Terraform bootstraps, so it is not a violation and
    shouldn't be graded as one. What it isn't is one-time. The thesis's list
    reads as a setup sequence performed once and then left alone; the actual
    arrival order is that a WI grant appears whenever a new platform
    component first needs a Google API — which is to say whenever
    `platform-config` gains content. Layer 0 and the GitOps repo turn out to
    be coupled on a schedule the design describes as sequential.
    The sharp part is why this particular grant can't be moved. Crossplane
    can manage IAM itself — `ProjectIAMMember` is in the C-03 kind list — so
    the *next* component's binding genuinely could arrive as a PR against
    `platform-config` rather than a terraform apply. Crossplane's own cannot,
    because that binding is precisely what lets it pull the provider packages
    that would do the granting. **The paved road can pave everything except
    its own on-ramp.**
    Worth carrying into C-01's grade as a named cost rather than an
    exception: the boundary holds, but there is one structural crossing per
    platform, plus one per component until Crossplane is running.

18. **The sync-wave ordering the whole app-of-apps depends on is off by
    default, and looks configured either way.** The register predicted
    "CRD-race / sync-wave workarounds required (a known friction the design
    doesn't currently acknowledge)" for C-04. It was right, and the specific
    friction is nastier than a race.
    Argo CD removed `Application` from its built-in health checks in 1.8. A
    sync wave gates on the previous wave's *health* — so with no health check
    for Applications, every child reports Healthy the instant it is created,
    every wave's gate is already open, and all children sync at once. The
    annotations are present, the ordering is expressed, and nothing enforces
    it. The failure would then surface one level down as an unrelated-looking
    error: the wave-1 `Provider` resources are Crossplane CRD types that do
    not exist until the wave-0 Crossplane install is actually running.
    Fixing it needed a Lua health check in `argocd-cm`
    (`resource.customizations.health.argoproj.io_Application`) that reports a
    child's own health up to its parent — and that had to live in
    `3-argocd`, i.e. in Terraform, not in `platform-config`. The reason is
    the same shape as surprise 8: **a setting that the sync order depends on
    cannot itself arrive by sync.** Argo CD reads `argocd-cm` at startup, and
    `platform-config` is the thing Argo CD syncs.
    What C-04 actually cost, recorded so the claim isn't graded as free: two
    Applications rather than one (waves 0 and 1), three waves inside the
    providers directory (ImageConfig → `provider-family-gcp` → the five
    service providers), `ServerSideApply=true` because Crossplane's CRDs
    exceed the annotation size limit client-side apply uses, a vendored copy
    of the Crossplane chart so the repo-server doesn't open a second egress
    path to `charts.crossplane.io`, and the argocd-cm health check above.
    Five workarounds, none of which the pattern doc mentions.
    Same family as surprises 12, 14 and 15 — tooling returning a confident,
    well-formed answer that points the wrong way — and the worst version of
    it, because here the wrong answer is *silence*: correct-looking YAML that
    orders nothing.

## Research verified

- **[C] provider-upjet-gcp kind coverage — C-03's doc half (verified
  2026-08-11** against `crossplane-contrib/provider-upjet-gcp` at tag
  v3.0.0: the shipped CRDs under `package/crds/`, the hand-curated
  `examples/` tree, and `docs/family/Configuration.md`). Every kind the
  Compositions need exists, at **both** scopes — cluster
  (`*.gcp.upbound.io`) and namespaced (`*.gcp.m.upbound.io`): Cloud SQL
  `DatabaseInstance` / `Database` / `User`; storage `Bucket`; cloudplatform
  `ServiceAccount` + `ProjectIAMMember` / `ServiceAccountIAMMember` /
  `BucketIAMMember`; artifact `RegistryRepository`; dns `RecordSet` and
  `ManagedZone`. This closes the research doc's standing watch item
  ("non-AWS providers lagged AWS on namespaced-MR support as of v2.3 —
  verify first"): at v3.0.0 the GCP family ships a `namespaced/` example
  directory for every service group, so the lag is gone. Two caveats worth
  carrying into M2: the Cloud SQL instance kind is **`DatabaseInstance`**,
  not `Instance` as the AWS-shaped matrix implies; and `RecordSet` ships as
  a CRD but appears only under `examples-generated/` (auto-generated from
  the Terraform docs) rather than the uptest-run `examples/` tree — present,
  but the one needed kind with no tested upstream example.
  C-03's remaining half (hands-on create of each kind) genuinely can't run
  until Compositions exist, which is M2 work — the register assigned this
  claim to M1, but only its doc half is an M1-shaped test.
- **[C] The GCP provider family is at v3.0.0 (released 2026-08-04) — a
  breaking major, five days before this check** (verified against the repo's
  release list and the v3.0.0 release notes). It removes all deprecated
  `v1beta1` APIs on the back of an upstream Terraform provider jump
  (v6.47.0 → v7.39.0) and ships a **mandatory Storage Version Migrator**
  that must run as an init container via `DeploymentRuntimeConfig` before
  upgrading from 1.x/2.x — skipping it leaves CRDs inconsistent and
  controllers failing to start. Greenfield here, so the migrator itself is
  moot; the finding is the timing. The research doc's pins (2026-07-28) were
  stale at exactly the moment they were first needed, which is the same
  lesson as the helm-provider-v3 catch, now with a second data point: pin
  the family explicitly in `platform-config` and treat its ~2-month cadence
  as a tracked dependency, not a detail.
- **[C] The Crossplane community package track is ghcr.io content — so the
  one lower-confidence remote repo isn't needed at all (verified 2026-08-11**
  by direct registry probe). `xpkg.crossplane.io` is a pass-through front
  for ghcr.io: it answers with ghcr.io's own bearer challenge
  (`realm="https://ghcr.io/token", service="ghcr.io"`), **accepts a
  ghcr.io-issued token**, and returns the **identical manifest digest**
  (`sha256:a2170b5c…46cfdf5`) for
  `crossplane-contrib/provider-gcp-storage:v3.0.0`. Consequence for
  ADR-0010 and C-23: the community track the research doc recommended is
  already covered by the existing `ghcr-io` remote, so provider packages can
  be referenced as
  `<region>-docker.pkg.dev/<project>/ghcr-io/crossplane-contrib/provider-gcp-*`
  and the `xpkg-upbound-io` repo in `registry.tf` — the only one carrying an
  [I] tag and an explicit "recheck at M2 before Crossplane depends on this"
  note — can be **deleted rather than re-verified**. The dependency flagged
  as riskiest turned out to be an unnecessary one.
- **[C] Provider/chart versions (verified 2026-08-01** against the Terraform
  registry API and Artifact Hub API, not memory): `hashicorp/google` latest
  stable 7.42.0; `hashicorp/helm` 3.2.0; `hashicorp/kubernetes` 3.2.1;
  `argo-cd` chart 10.2.2 (app v3.4.6). Notable: **helm provider v3 is a
  breaking change** — the v2 `provider "helm" { kubernetes { ... } }` block
  syntax is gone, replaced by a `kubernetes = { ... }` nested object
  (confirmed against the provider docs at the v3.2.0 tag). The kubernetes
  provider's config block did NOT make the equivalent change across its own
  2.x → 3.x. Exactly the class of drift the "verify against primary sources"
  rule exists for — training-data memory would have produced broken code.
- **[C] `terraform validate` does not evaluate cross-variable `validation`
  blocks — `terraform plan` does.** Confirmed by isolated reproduction during
  layer-0 authoring (a guard requiring `peer_gateway_ip` when `enable_vpn`
  is true fires at plan time but not under bare `validate`). Consequence for
  the method: "validate passed" is weaker evidence than it reads as; CI
  gates built later (C-11, C-22 territory) should not treat validate as
  proof that input guards hold.
- **[C] Artifact Registry remote-repo upstream coverage (verified
  2026-08-06** against the AR product docs and provider v7.42.0 docs):
  Docker Hub is the only preset; ghcr.io, registry-1.docker.io,
  public.ecr.aws, and registry.k8s.io are documented custom Docker
  upstreams; quay.io works (live example in terraform-provider-google
  issue #20278). Provider note: `docker_repository.custom_repository` is
  deprecated in v7.42 in favor of `common_repository` — another
  training-data trap avoided by checking. **[I] xpkg.upbound.io**: speaks
  the Docker Registry V2 protocol (direct probe) but has no documented or
  observed use as an AR remote — flagged in-code, re-verify at M2 before
  Crossplane depends on it.
- **[C] argo-cd chart 10.2.2 pulls redis from AWS's ECR Public Gallery**
  (`ecr-public.aws.com`, an alias of `public.ecr.aws`), not Docker Hub as
  assumed. Found by reconciling the chart's actual values at the pinned tag
  against the remote-repo list — the kind of silent egress dependency the
  ADR-0010 posture exists to surface. A sixth remote repo covers it.
- **[C] GKE node-SA guidance consolidated (verified 2026-08-06** against
  Google's current node-service-accounts and cluster-hardening docs): the
  long-standing four-granular-role pattern (logging.logWriter,
  monitoring.metricWriter, monitoring.viewer,
  stackdriver.resourceMetadata.writer) is superseded by one predefined
  role, `roles/container.defaultNodeServiceAccount`. The old pattern is
  still what blogs — and this build's own first spec — repeat; the fourth
  legacy role no longer appears in current docs at all. Also verified: orgs
  created after 2024-05-03 disable automatic IAM grants for default
  service accounts, which is what makes a dedicated node SA a functional
  requirement here, not just hygiene.
- **[C] `kubernetes_manifest` cannot bootstrap a CRD-typed object** onto a
  cluster that doesn't have the CRD yet (schema validation runs at plan
  time). The root Argo CD Application therefore rides in via the chart's
  `extraObjects` value, landing in the same Helm release that installs the
  CRDs. Relevant beyond M1: any Terraform-side creation of Crossplane XRs
  would hit the same wall — one more reason claims/XRs belong in GitOps, not
  Terraform (supports C-01's boundary).
  **Apply-time correction (2026-08-07): the second half of this entry was
  wrong.** The `kubernetes_manifest` limitation is real, but the
  `extraObjects` workaround fails too, one step later: the argo-cd chart
  templates its CRDs rather than shipping them in Helm's special `crds/`
  directory, and Helm validates all rendered objects against the cluster
  API before applying any — so the same release can't carry both the CRD
  and an instance of it. Working fix: the root Application as its own
  second Helm release (in-repo `root-app` chart, `depends_on` the argo-cd
  release), verified live. Kept uncorrected above deliberately — this
  entry carried a [C] tag and still broke, which is exactly the
  validate-vs-apply evidence gap (surprise 8) this log exists to record.

- **Cloud VPN requires a static peer IP — the premise check that killed the
  VPN plan (verified 2026-08-19** against Google's Cloud VPN overview). The
  documentation is unambiguous: the peer VPN gateway must have a static
  external, internet-routable IP address, and that address is required to
  configure Cloud VPN at all. This log had asserted three times that the VPN
  was the structural fix for residential IP churn; the assertion had never
  been checked against the requirement. HA VPN additionally requires BGP on
  the peer device. See surprise 13 — the interesting finding is not the
  requirement, it is that repetition had been substituting for verification.

- **GKE DNS-based control-plane endpoint (verified 2026-08-20** against
  Google's "About network isolation in GKE"). Google states the best practice
  directly: use only the DNS-based endpoint for control-plane access. It is a
  unique immutable FQDN per cluster, resolves to an endpoint reachable from
  any network that can reach Google Cloud APIs — on-premises and other clouds
  included — and explicitly "eliminates the need for a bastion host or proxy
  nodes." Authorization is IAM plus optional VPC Service Controls, not source
  address. Terraform surface confirmed against the provider source
  (`resource_container_cluster.go`, hashicorp/google v7.42):
  `control_plane_endpoints_config` carries `dns_endpoint_config`
  (`allow_external_traffic`, `enable_k8s_tokens_via_dns`,
  `enable_k8s_certs_via_dns`) and `ip_endpoints_config.enabled`. gcloud
  equivalent is `--enable-dns-access`.
  Confirmed empirically rather than only on paper: the endpoint resolves via
  public DNS (`dig @8.8.8.8` -> `216.239.32.27`). **It is a public name, not
  an internal address** — a point worth stating plainly, because the natural
  assumption is the opposite and the whole design depends on it being public.

- **IAP TCP forwarding — evaluated, not adopted (verified 2026-08-20** against
  Google's "Use IAP for TCP forwarding"). Forwards SSH, RDP and arbitrary TCP
  to VMs with no external IP; ingress is opened only to `35.235.240.0/20`, and
  authorization is `roles/iap.tunnelResourceAccessor`. Google's IAP-for-GKE
  page states the positioning outright — it "enables you to control
  resource-level access for employees instead of using a VPN" — and supports
  the Gateway API on GKE 1.24+. Rejected for the user-access plane only
  because IAP TCP forwarding targets Compute Engine instances rather than
  managed services, so a private Cloud SQL instance needs a jump VM running
  the Auth Proxy plus a tunnel to it: two hops where a subnet router gives
  `psql -h 10.x.x.x`. Recorded because it remains the GCP-native answer if
  ADR-0011's third-party dependency later proves unwelcome.

- **Tailscale control-plane architecture (verified 2026-08-20** against
  Tailscale's "How Tailscale works", subnet router, and Tailnet Lock docs).
  The coordination server is "essentially, a shared drop box for public keys";
  the control plane is hub-and-spoke but "carries virtually no traffic," and
  private keys never leave their node. **It therefore cannot be moved inside
  the VPC** — every node must reach it to exchange keys, so a private one is
  a chicken-and-egg, and self-hosting means Headscale, which Tailscale's own
  docs note "removes the availability guarantees and low maintenance
  overhead" of the SaaS. What goes in the VPC is a subnet router; the docs
  name this exact use case, "securely connect to cloud-managed services like
  Amazon RDS or Google Cloud SQL without exposing them to the public
  internet." The residual risk is that Tailscale's control plane can add
  nodes to a tailnet; Tailnet Lock is the documented mitigation, and with it
  "even if Tailscale were malicious or Tailscale infrastructure hacked,
  attackers can't send or receive traffic in your tailnet."

## Claims graded

Graded 2026-08-28 at M1 close, per ADR-0008. Three of the five claims the
register assigns to M1 are graded here; two are deferred, and the reason is
the same in both cases and is itself a finding — see "Two claims the register
mis-assigned" below.

### C-02 — Tear-down/rebuild is cheap → **HELD**

| 1 | Aug 18 | 9m13 | ~14m12 (clean-path; the run itself failed and was retried) | **1** |
| 2 | Aug 27→28 | 11m48 | 17m32 | **0** |
| 3 | Aug 28 | 9m57 | 17m18 | **0** |

The target is zero and two of three runs met it. The one that didn't was
cycle 1, whose intervention was the residential-IP allowlist (surprise 12) —
a mechanism that has since been **deleted rather than worked around**
(ADR-0011, the DNS-based endpoint). The configuration that produced the only
failure no longer exists, which is why this grades HELD rather than ADJUSTED.

Two honesty notes that belong in the grade, not under it:

- **Only cycles 1 and 2 actually test "between sessions."** C-02's wording is
  that the cluster can be destroyed *between sessions* and rebuilt. Cycle 3
  ran back-to-back with cycle 2 on already-warm credentials, so it tests
  reproducibility, not the session boundary — and the session boundary is
  where this build's most frequent intervention lives (three separate
  credential-expiry failure modes, none of which signals anything about the
  other two). The evidence for the boundary property is two runs, one of
  which failed on it.
- **`2-cluster` is the whole number and it is a constant.** 753s / 755s /
  755s across ten days. Down is the variable half and is GKE's drain
  behaviour rather than anything this repo controls.

**Open data point: actual monthly GCP spend.** The test asks for it and the
build cannot produce it — no BigQuery billing export was configured, and the
CLI exposes no cost surface without one. This is the **third** instance of
surprise 9's pattern (a claim's test is a requirement on the build), after
C-23's NAT logs and C-23's flow logs. Export was enabled 2026-08-28 into
`thecloudgeek.billing` (US multi-region, so Google backfills the current and
previous month — the M1 window is recoverable), but the export must be keyed
to billing account `0174CB-E6957B-042C42`, which is the one
`platform-factory-ref` bills to; the pre-existing table in that dataset
covers a different account. Grade stands on wall-clock and intervention
count, which are the two numbers the target is stated in; the cost figure is
a one-query follow-up, not a missing premise.

### C-04 — One app-of-apps owns the cluster surface → **HELD, for the surface M1 built**

Test: "fresh cluster reaches all-synced from empty with no manual ordering."
Cycles 2 and 3 both did exactly that — 3/3 Applications Synced/Healthy
(`root`, `crossplane` wave 0, `crossplane-providers` wave 1) in 173s and
162s, from an empty cluster, with nobody clicking anything.

**Scope, stated rather than implied:** the claim names Crossplane, Kyverno,
ESO, external-dns, gateway, and the XRDs/Compositions. M1 built the first of
those six. What is graded here is the *mechanism* — one app-of-apps, sync
waves, sync status as the single truth — not the full surface, and the claim
should be re-tested at M3 when the remaining addons land. A reader who takes
"HELD" to mean the whole list has been demonstrated would be reading more
than the evidence supports.

The data the test asked for — "CRD-race / sync-wave workarounds required" —
is **five**, detailed in surprise 18: two Applications instead of one, three
waves inside the providers directory, `ServerSideApply=true`, a vendored
Crossplane chart, and a Lua health check restored into `argocd-cm`. The
register predicted this friction and flagged that the design doesn't
acknowledge it. Both halves of that prediction were correct, and the last of
the five is the one worth carrying forward: **the ordering mechanism the
whole design depends on is off by default and looks configured either way.**

### C-23 — Image plane on the Google-API path → **HELD**

The strongest-evidenced claim in the milestone; graded on two independent
tests of two different pullers.

- **Kubelet (Aug 13).** A forced pull of `busybox:1.36` through a remote that
  had never been used — 2.909s, 2,217,006 bytes, resolving to a `pkg.dev`
  digest — while Cloud NAT logged exactly one connection, to GitHub. Because
  it was that remote's first use, Artifact Registry itself fetched from
  Docker Hub upstream, and that fetch produced no node-side egress.
- **Crossplane's package manager (Aug 28).** A different pod, identity and
  resolution path. Every image resolved to `*.pkg.dev`;
  `status.appliedImageConfigRefs` recorded
  `artifact-registry-mirror / RewriteImage`; the digest AR served for
  `provider-gcp-storage:v3.0.0` was byte-identical to the Aug 11 upstream
  probe; and NAT logs across the entire rebuild contained two destinations,
  both GitHub.

Five upstreams proxied in practice (quay, ghcr, ECR Public, Docker Hub, the
Crossplane package track via ghcr). No image needed an exception. The one
remote that looked riskiest — `xpkg-upbound-io`, the only `[I]`-tagged entry
in `registry.tf` — turned out to be **unnecessary rather than unproven**, and
is still deployed; deleting it is open cleanup.

### Two claims the register mis-assigned to M1

Both are deferred, both for the same structural reason, and the pattern is
the finding: **a claim's milestone assignment is a guess about when its test
can run, and that guess can be wrong in a way nobody notices until the
milestone tries to close.** Same family as surprise 9, one level up — surprise
9 is a test the build can't run; this is a test the *milestone* can't run.

- **C-01 — Terraform ends at layer 0 → stays UNTESTED.** Its test is "count
  `terraform apply` runs **after M1 completes**." At M1 close the measurement
  window has not opened. There is no honest way to grade this now, and no ADR
  to hang an ADJUSTED on. What M1 did produce is surprise 17, which predicts
  the shape of the eventual grade: the boundary holds, but "workload
  identity" is a recurring bootstrap cost rather than a one-time one, and
  Crossplane's own Artifact Registry grant is the one crossing that
  structurally cannot be delegated to the paved road. Grade at M2 close.
- **C-03 — provider-upjet-gcp kind coverage → stays UNTESTED.** Its test has
  two halves; only the first is M1-shaped. The primary-source check passed
  (Aug 11) and has now been strengthened on a live cluster — all eleven kinds
  Established at both scopes, 45 provider CRDs served. The second half,
  "hands-on create of each kind," requires Compositions that materialize real
  Cloud SQL instances and buckets, which is M2 work by the register's own
  milestone table. Grade at M2 close, when the remaining half can actually
  run.
