# M1: Spine — in progress (started 2026-08-01)

## Built

- **Org scaffold (Aug 1):** seven public repos live in the
  [`platform-factory`](https://github.com/platform-factory) GitHub org
  (`platform-bootstrap`, `platform-config`, `systems`, `edge-config`,
  `template-service`, `svc-hello`, `platform-knowledge`). Each has a README
  stub, Apache-2.0 LICENSE, CODEOWNERS, and an active `main-protection`
  ruleset (PRs required, force pushes and branch deletion blocked). Org teams
  `platform` and `security` exist; `edge-config`'s CODEOWNERS routes
  `/external/` to `@platform-factory/security` — the approval boundary in
  file form, present from the first commit.
- **Terraform layer 0 (Aug 1, in review):** `platform-bootstrap` PR authored
  as three independently-applied layers — `0-foundation` (project, billing
  link, APIs, state bucket), `1-cluster` (VPC, zonal GKE, workload identity),
  `2-argocd` (Argo CD + root Application). Split chosen so teardown between
  working sessions destroys only the cluster layers; the foundation persists
  at ~zero cost (this is the shape of the C-02 test).

## Data

- Org scaffold wall-clock: under two hours for repos + rulesets + teams,
  fully via `gh` CLI; zero cloud cost.
- Build runs on a GCP Free Trial billing account ($300 / 90 days) under a
  fresh identity — trial window comfortably covers the M1–M4 timeline.

## Surprises (running list — raw material for grading and the next ADR)

1. **The design said "a GitHub org, because the topology is the point" — and
   the build confirmed the org is load-bearing, not cosmetic.** The initial
   instinct was to scaffold under the existing user account; but user
   accounts cannot have teams, and team-based CODEOWNERS
   (`@platform-factory/security`) is what makes approval routing real rather
   than one username pasted everywhere. The claim C-15 test (rung enforceable
   by branch protection + CODEOWNERS alone) would have been untestable in a
   user-account topology.
2. **Solo-builder deadlock in the ruleset design.** The pattern assumes
   required reviews via CODEOWNERS, but GitHub won't let a PR author approve
   their own PR — with one human, `required_approving_review_count: 1` blocks
   every merge. Resolution: rulesets active from day one but with approval
   count 0; the count tightens when agent-authored PRs begin (M4), which is
   itself a cleaner story — the human reviewer requirement turns on exactly
   when a non-human author appears. This needs to be explicit in the M4 test
   design for C-15/C-16.
3. **The cost-optimal layer layout was not the corporate-real layout.** The
   first cut put the VPC in the torn-down-between-sessions layer, because a
   VPC is free and the cluster needs one. Ronak's correction: "in a real
   corporate environment, the cloud wouldn't live by itself — it would have
   other network connections." The mechanical forcing function agrees: an HA
   VPN gateway gets new Google-side public IPs when recreated, so a VPC that
   dies with the cluster means manually reconfiguring the peer (corp
   firewall, or the home-lab UniFi standing in for it) on every rebuild.
   Resolution: four layers — foundation and network persist; cluster and
   Argo CD are disposable. The boundary rule that fell out is worth keeping
   for the pattern docs: **identity and reachability persist; compute is
   disposable.** Cost yields to realism where they conflict (an idle VPN
   tunnel's ~$35–40/mo is the price of the theory being provable).
4. **"Terraform's last job" cuts earlier than the first execution attempt.**
   The first instinct was `gcloud projects create` + billing link by hand,
   then Terraform from the VPC down. Corrected mid-session (Ronak): if
   Terraform ends at layer 0, layer 0 should *begin* at the project. The
   irreducibly manual set is small and worth naming as C-01 evidence:
   interactive browser auth (`gcloud auth login`,
   `gcloud auth application-default login`), free-trial signup, and one
   `terraform init -migrate-state` after the state bucket exists. Everything
   else is code.

## Research verified

- (pending) provider-upjet-gcp kind coverage (C-03) — to be verified when
  Compositions are authored.
- **[C] Provider/chart versions (verified 2026-08-01** against the Terraform
  registry API and Artifact Hub API, not memory): `hashicorp/google` latest
  stable 7.42.0; `hashicorp/helm` 3.2.0; `hashicorp/kubernetes` 3.2.1;
  `argo-cd` chart 10.2.2 (app v3.4.6). Notable: **helm provider v3 is a
  breaking change** — the v2 `provider "helm" { kubernetes { ... } }` block
  syntax is gone, replaced by a `kubernetes = { ... }` nested object
  (confirmed against the provider docs at the v3.2.0 tag). The kubernetes
  provider's config block did NOT make the equivalent change across its own
  2.x → 3.x. Exactly the class of drift the "verify against primary sources"
  rule exists for — training-data memory would have produced broken code.
- **[C] `terraform validate` does not evaluate cross-variable `validation`
  blocks — `terraform plan` does.** Confirmed by isolated reproduction during
  layer-0 authoring (a guard requiring `peer_gateway_ip` when `enable_vpn`
  is true fires at plan time but not under bare `validate`). Consequence for
  the method: "validate passed" is weaker evidence than it reads as; CI
  gates built later (C-11, C-22 territory) should not treat validate as
  proof that input guards hold.
- **[C] `kubernetes_manifest` cannot bootstrap a CRD-typed object** onto a
  cluster that doesn't have the CRD yet (schema validation runs at plan
  time). The root Argo CD Application therefore rides in via the chart's
  `extraObjects` value, landing in the same Helm release that installs the
  CRDs. Relevant beyond M1: any Terraform-side creation of Crossplane XRs
  would hit the same wall — one more reason claims/XRs belong in GitOps, not
  Terraform (supports C-01's boundary).

## Claims graded

None yet — grading happens at milestone close per ADR-0008.
